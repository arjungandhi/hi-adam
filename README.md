# Hey Adam

I got bored. 

I wrote a more fun way for you to look at my work experience and check out my coding skills. 

So I wrote this thing. 

Just clone the repo. 

In the source folder you'll find a a requirements.txt and a pyproject.toml <- I use poetry for my python env management

Use either to install the dependencies 

And from the source folder run 

`python run_game.py adam.game`


# What is this. 

Basically I wrote a text based game engine. It currently has the following features. 

- uses a .game file for your story
- ask the user questions and redirect them to various sections. 
- pull images and auto convert them to text
- have title and subtitle text
- auto redirect back to a section
